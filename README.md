# React Workshop Guild
This repo contains all the resources we used during the frontend workshop for IEEE Newhacks 2024

We build the following Apps as Milestones

* Milestone 1: A counter in HTML (Only the structure, the counter does not work!)
* Milestone 2: Counter using React and style it using Tailwind CSS
* Milestone 3: Exchange rate App by fetching API
* Milestone 4: A password strength checker

## 2. Repo structure
The repository has four branches - `master`, `HTML`, `counter`, `exchange`, and `password`. Each branch corresponds to a milestone for the workshop

#### The `master` branch
The `master` branch contains all four Apps you built during the workshop. If you run `npm run dev`, you should see the following page, and you should be able to navigate around the three Apps

### The `HTML` branch
The `HTML` branch only contains an HTML file. You should see the following page after opening it.

Technically, the `workshop/my-project` directory still exists, but you do not need to worry about it at all

### The `exchange` branch
The `exchange` branch contains a home page, the counter App and the exchange rate App. If you run `npm run dev`, you should see the following page, and you should be able to navigate around the Apps and the home page

The API used for the exchange rate App is from - https://manage.exchangeratesapi.io

Please create your own account from that website and replace the API key in `workshop/my-project/app/exchange/page.tsx` with your own access key!!! Otherwise, the App may fail if the given API access key limit is reached

To navigate to the `exchange` branch, run `git checkout exchange`


### The `password` branch
It's exactly the same as the `master` branch, Idk why it should exist
